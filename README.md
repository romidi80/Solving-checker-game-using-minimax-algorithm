# Solving-checker-game-using-minimax-algorithm
Playing checker using minimax algorithm for finding the best next move.

This project involves the implementation of the checker game problem utilizing the minimax algorithm. Our approach begins with the completion of essential code segments that require implementation. Each section will be comprehensively described, outlining the methodology and rationale behind its construction.

Following the detailed exposition of these functions, our focus shifts to the comprehensive elucidation of the evaluation function tailored to address the problem. We will delve into the inner workings of this function, explaining both its design rationale and the reasons behind its specific definition.

Lastly, our endeavor extends to the testing phase, where we will apply the test cases provided in the problem description. Subsequent analysis of these test results will be conducted to gauge the effectiveness and accuracy of our implemented solution.
